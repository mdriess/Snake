Assignment Title: Snake
Assignment Description:Snake is a video game that originated during the late
1970s in arcades and has maintained popularity since then, becoming something
of a classic. After it became the standard pre-loaded game on Nokia phones in
1998, Snake found a massive audience. The player controls a long, thin
creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking
up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the
"walls" that surround the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece
of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult. The
user controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, or right),
and the snake's body follows. The player cannot stop the snake from moving
while the game is in progress, and cannot make the snake go in reverse.
However, Snake has had many variations since its release, depending on the
game's platform. These variations involve the modification of certain rules
e.g. the lethality of contact with walls.
